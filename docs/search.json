    "section": "",
    "text": "R√òMER Chain introduces an Austrian inspired economic model built on three foundational principles that work together to create a truly market-driven blockchain economy. By understanding how these principles interact, we can appreciate how R√òMER achieves both stability and efficiency in ways traditional blockchain networks cannot.\n\n\nAt the heart of R√òMER‚Äôs design is the recognition that computation itself is the fundamental product being traded. Unlike networks that treat computation as a secondary consideration, R√òMER explicitly bases its entire economic model on computational capacity. This begins with our base threshold, calibrated at 50% of the network‚Äôs total computational capacity.\nThis threshold serves as the network‚Äôs natural equilibrium point, creating a clear and predictable pricing structure for computational resources. When users purchase computation on R√òMER, they know exactly what they‚Äôre getting and what it will cost, enabling reliable business planning and efficient resource allocation. This predictability stems from our fixed per-operation pricing model, which maintains stable costs regardless of network conditions.\n\n\n\nR√òMER‚Äôs economic design draws heavily from Austrian economic principles, particularly in how it approaches value discovery and market dynamics. Instead of imposing artificial constraints or centrally planned parameters, R√òMER allows the market to determine value through actual usage patterns and participant behavior.\nThis alignment manifests in several ways. First, price discovery happens naturally through the interaction of supply and demand, with no artificial floors or ceilings. Second, the system avoids creating artificial scarcity, instead letting real resource constraints and market demand drive token economics. Perhaps most importantly, R√òMER enables true economic calculation by providing clear, stable pricing signals that market participants can use to make informed decisions.\n\n\n\nThe third principle addresses one of the most significant challenges in blockchain networks: cost predictability. R√òMER implements fixed operation pricing, which means that the cost of any given computation remains constant in nominal terms. This stability creates several important advantages for network participants.\nBusinesses can create reliable budgets for their blockchain operations, knowing that their costs won‚Äôt suddenly spike due to network congestion or speculative activity. The long-term planning horizon this enables is crucial for enterprise adoption, as organizations need to forecast their operational costs accurately. This predictability also encourages more efficient resource utilization, as users can optimize their operations around known, stable costs.\n\n\n\n\nThe 50% base computation threshold represents one of R√òMER‚Äôs most innovative economic mechanisms. This threshold creates a clear reference point for network operations while ensuring the system maintains sufficient capacity for demand spikes.\n\n\nSetting the base threshold at 50% of validator capacity creates a natural operating equilibrium that serves multiple purposes. First, it ensures the network always maintains substantial headroom for demand spikes, preventing the congestion issues that plague many blockchain networks. Second, it creates clear incentives for resource optimization, as operators can maximize their efficiency by targeting this known threshold.\nThe threshold also scales naturally with network growth, as computing power increases through hardware upgrades and network expansion. This creates a sustainable growth model where capacity can increase to meet demand while maintaining economic stability.\n\n\n\nThe threshold mechanism incorporates several economic safeguards to ensure network stability. Validator cost tracking provides real-time feedback about the economic sustainability of network operations. Anti-manipulation design features prevent gaming of the threshold mechanism, while hardware upgrade incentives ensure the network can scale to meet growing demand.\nThese safeguards focus particularly on network security, ensuring that the economic model supports rather than undermines the network‚Äôs security properties. This creates a virtuous cycle where economic stability reinforces network security, which in turn supports stable economics.\n\n\n\n\nR√òMER‚Äôs supply dynamics respond directly to network utilization, creating a natural feedback loop between usage and token supply. This mechanism operates differently depending on whether network usage is above or below the base threshold.\n\n\nWhen network usage exceeds 50% of capacity, several mechanisms activate to maintain stability. New R√òMER tokens are minted in proportion to the excess usage, creating natural supply expansion that helps maintain stable computation costs. The market price adjusts to reflect this increased supply, while resource optimization incentives become stronger to encourage efficient usage of the network‚Äôs capacity.\n\n\n\nDuring periods of lower network usage (below 50% capacity), the system automatically burns R√òMER tokens. This supply contraction helps maintain token value during periods of reduced demand. The burning mechanism creates stronger efficiency incentives, encouraging users to optimize their resource usage while ensuring the network remains economically sustainable even during lower utilization periods.\n\n\n\n\nThe economic model creates distinct incentives and opportunities for different types of market participants, each playing an important role in maintaining network stability.\n\n\nTraders in the R√òMER ecosystem focus on capacity utilization as their primary market signal. By monitoring the network‚Äôs position relative to the 50% threshold, they can identify trading opportunities while supporting system stability. Their trading activities help maintain price equilibrium and provide important market liquidity.\n\n\n\nFor users of the network, the economic model provides clear signals for optimizing their operations. The stable pricing allows for effective resource planning, while the capacity threshold creates natural incentives for efficient usage patterns. Users can time their operations to take advantage of lower utilization periods, leading to more efficient overall network usage.\n\n\n\nValidators play a crucial role in maintaining network capacity and security. The economic model encourages them to maintain optimal capacity while providing predictable economics for their operations. Geographic distribution adds another dimension to validator strategy, as different locations may offer varying advantages for network participation.\n\n\n\n\nOne of R√òMER‚Äôs most innovative features is its ability to maintain stability across different market conditions, particularly during the extreme swings common in cryptocurrency markets.\n\n\nDuring bull markets, when network usage typically exceeds 50% capacity, the system responds with controlled supply expansion. This helps maintain stable computation costs while encouraging hardware upgrades to meet increased demand. The model creates natural resistances to speculative excess while ensuring the network can scale to meet genuine usage growth.\n\n\n\nIn bear markets, when usage often falls below 50% capacity, the system‚Äôs automatic supply contraction helps maintain economic stability. The excess capacity available during these periods enables highly efficient operations, while the supply contraction provides natural price support. This creates a counter-cyclical stability mechanism that helps the network thrive even during market downturns.\n\n\n\n\nThe practical implementation of R√òMER‚Äôs economic model requires careful attention to technical details and system parameters.\n\n\nHere‚Äôs how the system calculates and responds to network utilization:\ndef calc_utilization():\n    total_capacity = get_validator_capacity()\n    current_usage = measure_network_load()\n    utilization = current_usage / total_capacity\n\n    # Compare to 50% threshold\n    if utilization &gt; 0.5:\n        return (utilization - 0.5) * 100\n    else:\n        return (0.5 - utilization) * 100\nThis calculation provides the basic input for the system‚Äôs supply adjustment mechanisms. When utilization exceeds 50%, the positive return value triggers token minting. When it falls below 50%, the negative return value triggers token burning.\n\n\n\nInitial network parameters are carefully calibrated to ensure stability from launch:\nThe validator configuration begins with hardware requirements sized for 200% of expected launch demand, providing substantial growth headroom while maintaining the 50% base threshold. This conservative initial sizing helps ensure network stability during the critical early period.\nEconomic parameters, including initial token supply and burn rates, are calibrated based on expected utilization patterns. The system includes reserves sized for extended periods of underutilization, ensuring it can maintain stability even during prolonged market downturns.\n\n\n\n\nR√òMER Chain‚Äôs economic model represents a fundamental advance in blockchain economics. By anchoring the system to physical computational capacity and implementing Austrian economic principles, we create a naturally stable and efficient market for blockchain computation.\nThe combination of fixed computational costs, capacity-based supply adjustment, and geographic distribution creates an environment where market forces drive sustainable growth and optimization. This approach provides the predictability that businesses require while maintaining the economic incentives necessary for long-term network sustainability.\nThrough its focus on real physical capacity and market-driven growth, R√òMER Chain establishes itself as a platform for sustainable blockchain computation with unique stability across market cycles. This stability, combined with predictable costs and clear economic signals, positions R√òMER to support the next generation of blockchain applications and enterprise adoption."

Despite not being a Rust developer by background, I found myself drawn to explore what could be built with these low-level primitives. It was different from my previous experiences with frameworks like Substrate and Cosmos SDK‚Äîthis was about building from fundamental components rather than working within a predefined structure.\nWhat started as a curiosity-driven experiment‚Äîbuilding a basic blockchain with Commonware‚Äîevolved into something more significant.

We simply implement our custom selection logic on top of this robust foundation.\nThe Automaton trait manages all consensus messaging and state transitions between nodes. We don‚Äôt have to worry about message delivery, retry logic, or network failures‚Äîwe just define our custom validation rules.\nThe Storage primitives handle the intricate details of persisting blockchain data. Block storage, journal management, and state synchronization are all provided out of the box.\nThe Runtime offers a production-grade async execution environment with proper error handling and resource management."

The Supervisor trait provides the interface‚Äîwe provide the logic.\nDynamic Token Economics: We can implement our unique tokenomics model and supply adjustment mechanisms without having to worry about how state changes are propagated through the network. Commonware‚Äôs storage primitives handle the heavy lifting of state management.\nFlexible Execution: Need to connect to an external VM or implement custom smart contract execution?

    "text": "The Power of Primitives\nThe beauty of this approach is that we get the best of both worlds: rock-solid infrastructure components built by world-class distributed systems engineers, combined with complete freedom to innovate on our unique features. We‚Äôre not fighting against framework assumptions or trying to modify someone else‚Äôs opinion about how blockchains should work.\nThe only alternative would have been building everything from scratch‚Äîimplementing our own networking stack, consensus messaging, storage layer, and runtime environment. Instead, Commonware gives us these capabilities as composable primitives, letting us focus our engineering efforts on the novel aspects of our design.\nConsider our Proof of Physics implementation: we can focus entirely on building the geographic validation and physical hardware verification systems because we‚Äôre not worrying about:\n\nHow blocks are stored and retrieved\nHow messages are delivered between nodes\nHow leader election state is maintained\nHow async operations are scheduled\nHow network connections are managed\n\nThis is what makes Commonware unique in the blockchain space. Other platforms force you to accept their opinions about these core components. Commonware just gives you the building blocks and lets you assemble them however you need."

    "text": "Imagine you‚Äôre at a busy auction house. Before an item goes up for bid, some buyers get to peek at what‚Äôs coming up next, while others have to wait. Those with the early peek have an obvious advantage - they can prepare their bids and strategy before anyone else. This is essentially what happens in financial markets through something called ‚Äúorder flow‚Äù - the stream of incoming trades that people want to make.\n\n\nLet‚Äôs start with a simple example from traditional stock trading. When you click ‚Äúbuy‚Äù on your trading app to purchase some Apple shares, your order doesn‚Äôt go directly to the stock exchange. Instead, it typically goes through several intermediaries, each of whom gets to see your intention to buy before it becomes public knowledge.\nThis advance knowledge is incredibly valuable. If someone knows you‚Äôre about to buy 1,000 shares of Apple at the market price, they could quickly buy shares themselves and sell them to you at a slightly higher price. This practice, known as front-running in traditional markets, has evolved into a sophisticated industry in the world of cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\nOn Wall Street, high-frequency trading (HFT) firms spend millions of dollars to place their computers as close as possible to stock exchanges. They even lay specialized cables to gain microsecond advantages in trading speed. When a pension fund wants to buy a large amount of shares, these HFT firms can spot the order coming and react before it hits the exchange.\nIn cryptocurrency markets, this race for speed has taken on new forms. Instead of building faster cables, traders compete to have their transactions included in the next block of a blockchain. This competition is what we call MEV (Maximal Extractable Value), and it‚Äôs become a multi-billion dollar industry.\n\n\n\nImagine you‚Äôre at a Las Vegas sportsbook during the Super Bowl. Bettors are lining up to place their wagers at betting windows. As the game progresses, the betting odds constantly change based on what‚Äôs happening on the field. Now imagine three different scenarios:\nFirst, think about someone who could see all the bets people are about to place before they reach the window. If they notice a large bet coming that might move the odds, they could quickly place their own bet first at better odds. This is exactly how order flow works in financial markets - seeing what trades are coming before they happen is incredibly valuable information.\nSecond, consider if someone could pay extra to jump to the front of the betting line during crucial moments - like right after a big touchdown when everyone‚Äôs rushing to place bets at the current odds. They‚Äôd have a huge advantage over other bettors who have to wait in line while the odds change. This is similar to how traders pay higher fees to have their transactions processed first in cryptocurrency markets.\nThird, picture if certain bettors had a special VIP betting window that processed their bets faster than the regular windows. While everyone else waits in long lines watching the odds change, these VIP bettors could always get their bets in quickly at the odds they want. This is like having special access to faster blockchain infrastructure.\nThis is similar to how order flow works in crypto markets. The line of people waiting to place bets is like the ‚Äúmempool‚Äù - where transactions wait to be processed. Different blockchain networks handle this queue of transactions in different ways.\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum treats its order box like a transparent auction house. Everyone can see the incoming orders, and traders can openly bid to have their transactions processed first. While this is transparent, it means that regular users often have to pay extra to have their transactions processed in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nSolana takes a different approach - like a special VIP line that only certain customers know about. While this prevents some types of front-running, it gives special advantages to those with insider access to the network.\n\n\n\n\nR√∏mer Chain is trying to create a fairer system through several innovations:\n\n\nThe Move VM takes a fundamentally different approach. Rather than allowing cheap transaction reverts, it requires all computational costs to be paid upfront. Success or failure, the resources consumed by a transaction must be paid for. This shifts the economic model from ‚Äútry everything and pay for successes‚Äù to ‚Äúcarefully validate before attempting.‚Äù The result is more efficient network usage and reduced spam opportunities.\n\n\n\nInstead of having one central location where all orders are processed, R√∏mer spreads out its order processing across many locations. This prevents any one location from having too much control over all the orders.\n\n\n\nRather than allowing geographic concentration to determine transaction ordering, R√∏mer‚Äôs consensus mechanism incorporates physical location as a core part of its design. This distributes transaction processing across a broader geographic area, reducing the advantages of proximity to any single point of infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\nThe goal isn‚Äôt to eliminate all MEV - that would be both impossible and, in some cases, undesirable. Rather, R√∏mer Chain aims to create a market structure where:\n\nValue extraction requires actual market intelligence rather than just technical advantages\nInfrastructure positioning can‚Äôt override market fundamentals\nFailed speculation has real costs that must be considered\nInformation flow follows natural network topology rather than centralized paths\n\nThis creates an environment where MEV extraction aligns more closely with genuine market making and price discovery, rather than pure technical exploitation. The result is a more efficient market where resources flow toward actual value creation rather than rent-seeking behavior.\n\n\n\nThe conversation around MEV often focuses on whether it can be eliminated. This misses the point. The real question is how we can structure markets to channel trading activity toward beneficial forms of value extraction while making harmful forms prohibitively expensive.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Our first task in building the devnet is establishing validator identity and location verification. Each validator needs a secure Ed25519 public-private key pair, which we store locally to maintain consistent identity across node restarts.\nLocation verification presents a more complex challenge. We‚Äôre currently evaluating two approaches: - Self-reported coordinates with future IP-based oracle verification - MaxMind IP range integration in genesis state\nBoth approaches have trade-offs. We‚Äôve temporarily deferred this decision to focus on other critical components.\n\n\n\nA core principle of R√∏mer Chain is the requirement for physical hardware. Our implementation actively detects virtualization, preventing nodes from running in cloud environments or virtual machines.

    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper presents R√òMER Chain‚Äôs tokenomics model, grounded in Austrian economic principles of sound money and market-driven price discovery. Through dynamic supply adjustment that both expands and contracts based on real market demand, R√òMER creates a system where token supply precisely reflects network utility. The model employs proportional fee burning during low-demand periods to reduce total supply, while allowing supply expansion only when genuine market demand exceeds network capacity. This approach creates a blockchain economy that responds organically to market conditions through both growth and contraction phases.\n\n\n\nTraditional blockchain networks often struggle with rigid monetary policies that fail to contract supply during periods of reduced demand, leading to price instability and misaligned incentives. R√òMER Chain takes a fundamentally different approach, embracing Austrian economic principles where market participants‚Äô actions determine not only supply expansion but also supply contraction, creating a truly responsive monetary system.\n\n\n\n\n\nR√òMER‚Äôs economic model is built on key Austrian economic concepts:\n\nNatural Price Discovery: All prices emerge from genuine market activity rather than central planning.\nSound Money Principles: Token supply adjusts bidirectionally based on real market demand.\nMarket-Driven Growth and Contraction: Network monetary policy responds organically to actual usage patterns.\nTime Preference: The model acknowledges that market participants have different time preferences for computation resources.\n\n\n\n\nThe model implements these principles through three interconnected mechanisms:\n\nBase Validator Rewards: A steady emission of 1 R√òMER per block to validators, representing the baseline cost of securing the network.\nDynamic Supply Control: Fee burning that exceeds validator emissions during low demand periods, creating natural supply contraction.\nDemand-Based Issuance: New token issuance occurs only when compute demand exceeds the network‚Äôs base capacity, representing genuine market growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe system recognizes three natural market states:\n\nBelow Market Demand Threshold\n\nValidator rewards: 1 R√òMER per block\nFee burning: &gt;1 R√òMER per block (exceeds validator emissions)\nNet result: Supply contraction reflecting reduced market demand\nNatural price discovery through supply reduction\nBlock space optimization opportunities: Fixed block cost enables bulk transaction efficiency\n\nDuring low demand periods, the system actively reduces total supply by burning more tokens than are emitted. The burn rate is proportional to how far below the base threshold demand has fallen. This creates a natural supply contraction that maintains price equilibrium even during market downturns. For example:\nIf demand is at 50% of base threshold:\n- Validator emission: 1 R√òMER/block\n- Fee burning: 2 R√òMER/block\n- Net supply change: -1 R√òMER/block\nThis mechanism also incentivizes efficient block space usage through transaction batching, as users can optimize their costs by aggregating multiple transactions during low-demand periods.\nAt Market Equilibrium\n\nValidator rewards: 1 R√òMER per block\nFee burning: 1 R√òMER per block\nNet result: Stable supply, reflecting market equilibrium\nNatural price discovery at market-clearing rates\nNetwork operates at optimal capacity for DEX operations\n\nAbove Base Capacity\n\nValidator rewards: 1 R√òMER per block\nFee burning: Continues at 1 R√òMER per block\nAdditional supply: Minted based on excess demand above base capacity\nNatural price discovery through supply expansion\nMEV opportunities increase with transaction volume\n\n\n\n\n\nThe system employs two distinct formulas for supply adjustment:\nDuring Low Demand:\nDemand Deficit = Base Compute Units - Current Compute Units\nBurn Rate = Base Burn Rate √ó (Base Compute Units / Current Compute Units)\nNet Supply Change = Validator Emission - Burn Rate\nDuring High Demand:\nExcess Demand = Current Compute Units - Base Compute Units\nSupply Increase = Excess Demand √ó Market Price\nThis creates a symmetric response to market conditions, where supply can both expand and contract based on real usage patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFee burning serves a more sophisticated economic function than just offsetting emissions. During low-demand periods, enhanced fee burning actively reduces total supply to maintain true market equilibrium. This mechanism:\n\nReduces total supply when network usage falls below base capacity\nCreates natural price support during market downturns\nMaintains computation cost efficiency across market cycles\nEnsures token supply accurately reflects actual network utility\n\n\n\n\nThe burn rate scales proportionally with demand reduction: - Lower demand triggers higher burn rates - Supply contracts more quickly during sharp demand drops - System naturally finds new equilibrium points - Creates predictable price dynamics during market cycles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidators receive compensation through multiple market mechanisms that naturally scale with network usage:\n\nBase Block Rewards\n\nConsistent emission of 1 R√òMER per block\nPredictable foundation for network security\nValue of rewards increases during low-demand periods due to supply contraction\n\nMEV-Driven Revenue Scaling\n\nAs compute requirements increase, MEV opportunities grow proportionally\nHigher network usage creates more profitable MEV extraction scenarios\nMEV rewards naturally offset increased operational costs during high-demand periods\nNo need to adjust base block rewards as MEV provides automatic economic scaling\n\nValue Appreciation\n\nSupply contraction during low demand supports value stability\nIncreased network utility drives organic value growth\nDynamic supply adjustment creates natural price discovery\n\n\nThis multi-layered reward structure ensures validators remain incentivized across market cycles, as the value of their base rewards adjusts naturally through supply dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR√òMER defines market equilibrium through a concrete, measurable metric: the ability to process more token swaps per block than any other major blockchain network while maintaining lower costs per swap. This is achieved by:\n\nComprehensive Market Analysis\n\nCollecting historical gas costs for swaps across Ethereum, Solana, and Base\nAnalyzing throughput capabilities of major DEX platforms\nMeasuring actual user costs across different market conditions\nTracking yearly trends in swap efficiency\n\nSetting Competitive Parameters\n\nBase compute capacity calibrated to exceed leading networks‚Äô swap throughput\nTarget costs positioned below market average for equivalent operations\nRegular adjustment of parameters based on market evolution\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket participants can adjust base parameters quarterly based on: - Observed market conditions - Actual network utilization - Real validator economics - Genuine developer needs - Market competition\nThis provides a framework for natural market evolution while maintaining predictability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial network parameters will be set based on: - Observed market rates for computation - Natural validator economic requirements - Real testnet usage patterns - Security considerations\n\n\n\nThe quarterly governance process allows for natural market evolution through: 1. Market data collection and analysis 2. Community discussion of real market conditions 3. Proposal submission based on observed needs 4. Stakeholder voting 5. Implementation of market-approved changes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe R√òMER economic model creates interesting game theoretic scenarios that encourage efficient market behavior:\n\nBulk Transaction Efficiency\n\nDuring low demand periods, fixed block costs create opportunities for transaction batching\nMarket participants can optimize their costs by aggregating multiple transactions\nHigher burn rates during low demand increase incentives for efficient block usage\nNatural formation of transaction pools and batching services\n\nStrategic Timing\n\nUsers can optimize their costs by monitoring network utilization\nBulk operations become more attractive during low-demand periods\nCreates natural load balancing through economic incentives\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship between compute requirements and MEV opportunities creates additional game theoretic considerations:\n\nValidator Competition\n\nHigher compute requirements lead to more complex MEV opportunities\nValidators must balance resource allocation between transaction processing and MEV extraction\nNatural market for specialized MEV extraction services\n\nUser Strategy\n\nUsers can optimize their transaction timing and grouping based on MEV patterns\nCreates opportunities for MEV-aware transaction strategies\nEncourages development of sophisticated trading and arbitrage systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR√òMER Chain‚Äôs tokenomics model represents a practical implementation of Austrian economic principles in a blockchain context. By implementing dynamic supply adjustment that responds to market conditions through both expansion and contraction, the system maintains true economic equilibrium across market cycles.\nThe combination of proportional fee burning, validator rewards, and natural price discovery creates an environment where genuine market forces determine network economics. The addition of game theoretic elements around block space usage and MEV distribution further enhances the system‚Äôs efficiency and sustainability.\nThrough its focus on market leadership in DEX operations and its carefully balanced economic incentives, R√òMER Chain positions itself as a platform for sustainable, market-driven growth in decentralized computation, with the unique ability to maintain economic stability through both growth and contraction phases."

The burn rate is proportional to how far below the base threshold demand has fallen. This creates a natural supply contraction that maintains price equilibrium even during market downturns. For example:\nIf demand is at 50% of base threshold:\n- Validator emission: 1 R√òMER/block\n- Fee burning: 2 R√òMER/block\n- Net supply change: -1 R√òMER/block\nThis mechanism also incentivizes efficient block space usage through transaction batching, as users can optimize their costs by aggregating multiple transactions during low-demand periods.\nAt Market Equilibrium\n\nValidator rewards: 1 R√òMER per block\nFee burning: 1 R√òMER per block\nNet result: Stable supply, reflecting market equilibrium\nNatural price discovery at market-clearing rates\nNetwork operates at optimal capacity for DEX operations\n\nAbove Base Capacity\n\nValidator rewards: 1 R√òMER per block\nFee burning: Continues at 1 R√òMER per block\nAdditional supply: Minted based on excess demand above base capacity\nNatural price discovery through supply expansion\nMEV opportunities increase with transaction volume\n\n\n\n\n\nThe system employs two distinct formulas for supply adjustment:\nDuring Low Demand:\nDemand Deficit = Base Compute Units - Current Compute Units\nBurn Rate = Base Burn Rate √ó (Base Compute Units / Current Compute Units)\nNet Supply Change = Validator Emission - Burn Rate\nDuring High Demand:\nExcess Demand = Current Compute Units - Base Compute Units\nSupply Increase = Excess Demand √ó Market Price\nThis creates a symmetric response to market conditions, where supply can both expand and contract based on real usage patterns."

This ensures that larger operators cannot dominate the governance process.\nPassage Requirements A proposal must meet these criteria to pass:\n\n\nOver 67% participation from active validators\nOver 75% approval from voting validators\nNo more than 30% increase in any single requirement\n\n\n\n\nTo maintain network stability, several constraints apply to requirement adjustments:\n\nTiming Restrictions\n\n\nMinimum 90 days between successful requirement changes\nMaximum one active proposal per resource type\nGrace period cannot be shortened\n\n\nSize Limitations\n\n\nMaximum 30% increase per vote\nNo more than 100% total increase per year\nCannot decrease requirements\n\n\nTechnical Validations\n\n\nRAM must be standard sizes (e.g., 32GB, 64GB)\nStorage must be practical configurations\nCPU requirements must align with available hardware\n\n\n\n\nConsider a proposal to increase minimum RAM from 32GB to 64GB:\n\nInitial Phase\n\n\nValidators running 64GB+ RAM notice increased state size\nProposal created with support from 5% of validators\nVoting period begins\n\n\nVoting Process\n\n\nValidators evaluate impact on their operations\nCommunity discusses hardware availability and costs\nReal-time voting progress visible to all participants\n\n\nImplementation If approved:\n\n\n30-day grace period begins\nOperators prepare hardware upgrades\nNetwork clients update requirement checks\nNew requirements take effect at specified block height\n\n\n\n\nWhen minimum requirements change, the fee model automatically adjusts because all resource costs are calculated as fractions of total capacity. For example, if RAM requirements double:\n\nBlock Capacity\n\n\nNew target RAM per block: 32GB (50% of 64GB)\nComputational units scale proportionally\nStorage capacity adjusts with new minimums\n\n\nFee Adjustments\n\n\nPer-unit costs adjust automatically\nOverall economic model remains stable\nUser costs effectively decrease as capacity increases\n\n\nNetwork Benefits\n\n\nIncreased transaction throughput\nBetter state management capability\nImproved performance for complex operations\nFuture-proofing for network growth"

R√∏mer Chain is building the first blockchain infrastructure that protects and enhances your regional advantage.\n\n\n\n\nOur first development phase focuses on the foundation of regional market making: ensuring validators are physically present in their operating regions. This creates natural geographic advantages that cloud providers cannot replicate, protecting local market makers from global firms attempting to compete in multiple regions simultaneously.\nThink of this as building the secure foundation that protects your regional trading advantage. When you operate a R√∏mer validator, you gain natural latency advantages that distant competitors cannot overcome, regardless of their technical resources.\nCurrent Status: We are implementing and testing our core validator infrastructure with built-in geographic protections.\n\n\n\nThe second phase focuses on integrating professional trading capabilities directly into validator nodes.
