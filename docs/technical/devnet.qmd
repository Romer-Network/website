# RÃ¸mer Chain Development Milestones

## Phase 1: Core Network Bootstrap

### Milestone 1.1: Genesis and Block Production
The network must first demonstrate basic operation with a single node producing empty blocks. This establishes the foundation for all future development.

Primary Goals:

- Fix Commonware storage integration for genesis block
- Implement basic block production with timestamps
- Create basic network startup sequence
- Validate block sequence integrity

### Milestone 1.2: Economic Engine Core
Implementing a simplified ledger-based token system allows testing of economic principles without requiring full transaction support.

Primary Goals:

- Implement internal token ledger system
- Create genesis supply tracking
- Build supply adjustment algorithms
- Implement basic treasury record-keeping
- Maintain mint and burn history

## Phase 2: Network Coordination

### Milestone 2.1: Leader Election
Even with a single validator, the network must implement proper leader election mechanics to prepare for future expansion.

Primary Goals:

- Implement leader election protocol
- Create validator scoring system
- Build election state management
- Test single-validator scenarios
- Prepare for multi-validator support

### Milestone 2.2: Network Performance Infrastructure
Before expanding to multiple validators, the system needs infrastructure to measure and validate network performance.

Primary Goals:

- Build network performance measurement
- Create latency tracking systems
- Implement regional performance benchmarks
- Develop network topology mapping
- Set up performance data storage

## Phase 3: Validator Network Expansion

### Milestone 3.1: Basic ZK Proof System
Validators must prove their physical presence before joining the network.

Primary Goals:

- Implement basic hardware verification proofs
- Create proof submission system
- Build verification infrastructure
- Set up validator identity management
- Test proof validation process

### Milestone 3.2: Validator Onboarding
The network must support multiple validators joining and participating in consensus.

Primary Goals:

- Create validator registration process
- Implement multi-validator coordination
- Build validator state synchronization
- Deploy test validators across regions
- Validate network performance metrics

## Phase 4: Transaction Integration

### Milestone 4.1: Sui Integration
Connecting to the Sui ecosystem represents a major expansion of network capabilities.

Primary Goals:

- Set up Sui node integration
- Implement mempool monitoring
- Create transaction validation system
- Build state management interface
- Migrate from ledger to full token system

### Milestone 4.2: Full Network Operation
The final phase brings all components together into a complete, operational network.

Primary Goals:

- Implement full transaction processing
- Create block execution pipeline
- Build SDK integration
- Deploy monitoring systems
- Complete system documentation

## Testing Requirements

Each milestone requires:

- Functional testing of new components
- Integration testing with existing systems
- Performance validation
- Security review
- Documentation updates

## Success Metrics

Milestone completion requires:

- Working software deployment
- Meeting performance targets
- Passing security requirements
- Documentation completion
- Operational validation

This roadmap prioritizes building a working network first, then gradually adding complexity. Each phase builds directly on previous work, maintaining a functional system throughout development.
