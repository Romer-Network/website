# Rømer Chain Development Roadmap

The Rømer Chain development process progresses through a series of devnet phases, each validating critical components of the system. The first three phases focus on core infrastructure, economic systems, and market making functionality, creating a complete but simplified system. Later phases will integrate virtual machine capabilities based on market requirements and technological evolution.

## Devnet 1: Physical Infrastructure Validation

The first development phase establishes the foundation of Rømer Chain's physical security model through zero-knowledge proofs of hardware and location. This creates the basis for regional market making advantages.

### Core Components

The system must demonstrate:

1. Zero-Knowledge Proof Generation
   - Hardware specifications validation
   - Geographic location verification
   - Network path confirmation
   - Infrastructure control validation

2. Proof Verification System
   - Proof submission pipeline
   - Verification node infrastructure
   - Cross-validation mechanisms
   - Proof storage and retrieval

3. Basic Block Production
   - Genesis block creation
   - Block sequencing with timestamps
   - Simple consensus on block hashes
   - Multi-validator agreement

### Success Criteria

Devnet 1 completion requires:

- Validators successfully generating and verifying hardware proofs
- Confirmed geographic distribution of test nodes
- Stable block production with validator agreement
- Complete proof verification documentation
- Working node deployment process

## Devnet 2: Economic Engine Implementation

The second phase implements Rømer Chain's Austrian economic model, establishing the foundation for sustainable network operations through market-driven supply management.

### Core Components

1. Token Economics
   - Base validator rewards (1 RØMER per block)
   - Supply adjustment mechanisms
   - Treasury management system
   - Burn reserve tracking

2. Network Usage Simulation
   - Randomized usage patterns
   - Threshold monitoring
   - Supply response validation
   - Economic metric tracking

3. Leader Selection
   - Performance-based selection
   - Geographic rotation
   - Validator scoring system
   - Leadership transition handling

### Success Criteria

Devnet 2 completion requires:

- Functional token emission system
- Verified supply adjustment mechanisms
- Working leader selection process
- Economic simulation results
- Complete system monitoring

## Devnet 3: Market Maker Integration

The third phase integrates core market making functionality directly into validator nodes, creating the foundation for professional trading operations. This phase uses simulated order execution to validate the complete infrastructure.

### Core Components

1. Access Control System
   - Role-based permissions
   - Multi-signature support
   - Trading limits and thresholds
   - Emergency controls

2. Trading Interface
   - Order management system
   - Position tracking
   - Risk controls
   - Market data handling

3. Parameter Management
   - Trading configuration
   - Risk parameters
   - Regional settings
   - Performance optimization

4. Order Simulation
   - Basic matching engine
   - Simulated executions
   - Performance validation
   - Market impact modeling

### Success Criteria

Devnet 3 completion requires:

- Working multi-signature trading
- Functional order management
- Complete access control system
- Successful order simulation
- Parameter management tools

## Future Development: Virtual Machine Integration

After validating core infrastructure through the first three devnet phases, subsequent development will focus on virtual machine integration. While current plans favor the Sui Move VM for its safety features and performance characteristics, this decision remains flexible based on:

- Market maker requirements
- Performance analysis
- Security considerations
- Ecosystem evolution
- Technical advances

This phase will be defined in detail after gathering feedback from market makers and analyzing results from the initial devnet phases.

## Development Philosophy

This roadmap creates a systematic validation of Rømer Chain's core innovations:

1. Physical Infrastructure: Devnet 1 proves the feasibility of geographic validation
2. Economic Systems: Devnet 2 demonstrates sustainable network economics
3. Market Making: Devnet 3 validates the complete trading infrastructure

Each phase builds directly on previous work while maintaining focus on the core requirements. By completing these phases with simulated order execution, we can validate the complete system without being constrained by virtual machine implementation details.

The flexible approach to VM integration ensures we can adapt to market requirements and technological evolution while maintaining our focus on market maker needs and physical infrastructure advantages.
