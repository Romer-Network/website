# Network Architecture

Rømer Chain's network architecture combines three powerful technologies to create high-performance trading infrastructure: Simplex Consensus for rapid finality, Commonware primitives for robust foundations, and decoupled state machine replication for optimal performance. Together, these create a system uniquely suited for professional market making operations.

### Simplex Consensus

Rømer Chain builds on [Simplex Consensus](https://simplex.blog/), a breakthrough in blockchain consensus that achieves transaction acceptance in just two network hops and finality in three. This represents a significant improvement over traditional consensus mechanisms that require 4-6 hops for transaction acceptance.

Simplex's unique approach to consensus perfectly aligns with our focus on market making operations. By achieving finality in just three network hops, we enable the rapid transaction processing essential for professional trading operations. This speed advantage becomes particularly crucial in our geographic validation system, where regional market makers can achieve near-instant finality for local transactions.

The system maintains security through a combination of physical infrastructure requirements and cryptographic validation, ensuring that the speed advantages of Simplex don't come at the cost of network security. This creates an ideal foundation for our market-making focused infrastructure.

### Commonware Primitives

Our network leverages Commonware primitives to provide robust, performance-optimized foundations for core blockchain operations. These primitives span three critical areas: storage, peer-to-peer networking, and cryptography.

The storage primitives enable efficient state management and rapid access to blockchain data, crucial for processing high volumes of trading operations. Our peer-to-peer networking layer optimizes message passing between nodes, with particular attention to geographic topology and network path optimization.

Cryptographic primitives provide the security foundation for our network, including specialized operations for our geographic validation system and hardware attestation requirements. These primitives work together to create a secure, efficient foundation for our trading infrastructure.

### Decoupled State Machine Replication

Rømer Chain implements decoupled state machine replication to optimize performance and scalability. This architecture separates transaction ordering from execution, allowing each component to be optimized independently while maintaining system consistency.

By decoupling these operations, we achieve several crucial advantages. Transaction ordering can be optimized for speed and geographic distribution, while execution can be tuned for complex trading operations and state management. This separation also enables more efficient resource utilization, as nodes can specialize in either ordering or execution roles.

The decoupled architecture proves particularly valuable for market making operations, where rapid transaction ordering must be balanced with complex execution logic for sophisticated trading strategies and risk management.
