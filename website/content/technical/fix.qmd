# FIX Protocol Integration

Rømer Chain provides native FIX protocol support, enabling traditional finance institutions to connect directly to the blockchain without modifying their existing trading infrastructure. Our implementation creates a seamless bridge between traditional finance and Web3 by supporting standard FIX workflows while leveraging blockchain security and capabilities.

### Secure Session Management

Rømer Chain revolutionizes FIX session management by integrating blockchain cryptography with standard FIX workflows. Rather than managing separate credentials for each venue, market makers use their blockchain identity secured by BLS signatures for authentication and session management.

When establishing a session, market makers create a standard FIX Logon message with their SenderCompID, but instead of traditional password authentication, they sign the session initiation data with their BLS private key. This signature, included in the password field, provides cryptographic proof of identity that the sequencer can verify using the market maker's known public key.

Once authenticated, sessions proceed exactly as they would with any traditional FIX server. The sequencer manages sequence numbers, heartbeats, and message resend requests according to standard FIX protocols. This approach combines the security benefits of blockchain cryptography with the operational familiarity of traditional FIX session management, allowing market makers to maintain their existing workflows while gaining enhanced security.

### Comprehensive Trading Support

Our FIX implementation begins with robust support for fundamental order types, ensuring market makers can immediately begin trading using familiar message formats. At launch, we support market and limit orders through standard FIX messages, with execution reports and order management flowing through traditional FIX workflows.

The system translates these FIX messages into their blockchain equivalents in real-time, ensuring that orders execute with the security and transparency guarantees of the blockchain while maintaining FIX-standard reporting and management capabilities. Market makers can monitor positions, manage orders, and receive executions exactly as they would with any traditional venue.

As the platform matures, we will systematically expand support to include advanced order types. Each new addition will be backed by corresponding on-chain functionality, ensuring that sophisticated trading strategies can leverage blockchain capabilities while maintaining standard FIX workflows. This progressive enhancement approach allows market makers to grow their trading capabilities naturally as the platform evolves.

### Asset Issuance and Settlement

Rømer Chain introduces a standardized token framework that integrates seamlessly with existing FIX custody and settlement processes. Traditional custodians can use familiar FIX message types to issue and manage digital assets, creating a bridge between traditional custody operations and blockchain-based assets.

The system supports the full lifecycle of asset management through standard FIX messages. Custodians can issue new tokens, manage supply, and handle settlements using the same message types they currently use for traditional assets. This standardization extends to money movement as well, with support for standard FIX settlement messages to handle deposits and withdrawals.

This approach creates a natural path for bringing traditional assets on-chain. Custodians can maintain their existing operational workflows while leveraging blockchain capabilities for settlement and asset management. The result is a system that combines the best of both worlds: the operational familiarity of FIX with the settlement efficiency and transparency of blockchain technology.
