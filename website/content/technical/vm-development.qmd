# Move VM Development Plan

Our execution engine builds upon Sui's proven Move VM implementation, carefully extracting and adapting the components we need for market making operations. Rather than building a Move VM from scratch, we leverage Sui's production-tested code while creating our own simplified adapter layer focused specifically on trading operations.

## Understanding Sui's Architecture

Sui structures their Move implementation across several key crates within their `sui-execution` directory. This architecture separates core VM functionality from Sui-specific features, allowing us to use the fundamental VM components while building our own specialized layer for trading operations.

The core components we need from Sui's implementation include:

```rust
// Core Move VM runtime - handles bytecode execution
move-vm-runtime = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git" }

// Bytecode verification - ensures code safety
move-bytecode-verifier = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git" }

// Module format definitions - handles Move binaries
move-binary-format = { git = "https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git" }
```

## Our Execution Engine Architecture 

We will create a focused execution engine that integrates these Move components with our trading-specific functionality:

```rust
pub struct RomerExecutionEngine {
    // The core Move VM from Sui
    vm: MoveVM,
    
    // Our trading-specific native functions
    natives: NativeFunctionTable,
    
    // Simplified verifier for our needs
    verifier: RomerVerifier,
    
    // Order book state management
    state: OrderBookState,
}

impl RomerExecutionEngine {
    pub fn new() -> Result<Self> {
        // Initialize with only DEX-related native functions
        let natives = build_dex_natives();
        
        // Create VM with minimal configuration
        let vm = MoveVM::new_with_config(
            natives.clone(),
            VMConfig {
                verifier: VerifierConfig::default(),
                max_binary_format_version: 6,
                runtime_limits_config: VMRuntimeLimitsConfig {
                    vector_len_max: 1000,
                    max_value_nest_depth: Some(128),
                    ..Default::default()
                }
            },
        )?;

        Ok(Self {
            vm,
            natives,
            verifier: RomerVerifier::new(),
            state: OrderBookState::new(),
        })
    }
}
```

## Implementation Phases

Our development process focuses on incrementally building our execution engine while leveraging Sui's proven components.

### Phase 1: Core VM Integration (Weeks 1-2)

The first phase establishes our basic execution environment:

1. Setup Dependencies
   - Import core Move crates from Sui
   - Create our project structure
   - Set up build configuration

2. Basic VM Initialization
   - Create minimal VM configuration
   - Initialize core Move VM
   - Set up basic module loading
   - Verify simple Move code execution

3. Initial Testing
   - Create basic test modules
   - Verify module loading
   - Test simple execution
   - Establish performance baselines

### Phase 2: Trading Extensions (Weeks 3-4)

Next, we build our trading-specific functionality:

1. Native Functions
   - Implement order creation
   - Add position tracking
   - Create price calculations
   - Build market data functions

2. State Management
   - Design order book state
   - Implement position tracking
   - Create state updates
   - Build query interface

3. Contract Loading
   - Extract DeepBook modules
   - Adapt for our environment
   - Create deployment tools
   - Test contract loading

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing (Weeks 5-6)

Finally, we integrate with our sequencer and implement comprehensive testing:

1. Sequencer Integration
   - Create transaction processor
   - Implement ordered execution
   - Add state synchronization
   - Build response handling

2. Testing Suite
   - Unit test coverage
   - Integration tests
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Stress testing

## Key Implementation Details

### Native Functions

Our native function table focuses on essential trading operations:

```rust
fn build_dex_natives() -> NativeFunctionTable {
    // Start with minimal Move natives
    let mut natives = NativeFunctionTable::new();
    
    // Add order management
    natives.register_function(
        "order",
        "create",
        create_order_native,
    );
    
    // Add position tracking
    natives.register_function(
        "position",
        "update",
        update_position_native,
    );
    
    // Add price calculations
    natives.register_function(
        "price",
        "calculate",
        calculate_price_native,
    );
    
    natives
}
```

### Verifier Implementation

We create a focused verifier that handles our specific needs:

```rust
pub struct RomerVerifier {
    // Basic Move verification
    move_verifier: Verifier,
    
    // Trading-specific checks
    dex_verifier: DexVerifier,
}

impl RomerVerifier {
    pub fn verify_module(&self, module: &CompiledModule) -> Result<()> {
        // Run basic Move verification
        self.move_verifier.verify(module)?;
        
        // Add our trading-specific checks
        self.dex_verifier.verify_trading_safety(module)?;
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Our development process emphasizes incremental progress and thorough testing:

1. Environment Setup
   - Clone Sui repository
   - Extract needed components
   - Set up development tools
   - Create test infrastructure

2. Iterative Development
   - Start with minimal VM
   - Add features incrementally
   - Continuous testing
   - Regular performance checks

3. Integration Testing
   - Module loading tests
   - Execution validation
   - State management
   - Error handling

## Testing Strategy

Testing focuses on both correctness and performance:

1. Unit Testing
   - VM initialization
   - Module loading
   - Native functions
   - State management

2. Integration Testing
   - Full execution flows
   - State synchronization
   - Error conditions
   - Recovery scenarios

3. Performance Testing
   - Execution latency
   - State access speed
   - Memory usage
   - Transaction throughput

## Success Criteria

The execution engine must meet these requirements:

1. Functionality
   - Successful Move execution
   - Correct order processing
   - Accurate state management
   - Proper error handling

2. Performance
   - Module load time < 50ms
   - Transaction execution < 1ms
   - State updates < 100Î¼s
   - Memory usage < 1GB

This development plan creates a focused execution engine that leverages Sui's proven Move implementation while maintaining the simplicity and performance required for our trading operations. By carefully selecting which components to use from Sui's implementation, we can build a robust system without reinventing core VM functionality.
