# Rømer Chain Development Roadmap

Rømer Chain's development follows a market-driven approach, prioritizing actual market maker needs over theoretical requirements. Our roadmap focuses on validating core components through a series of devnet phases, with each phase building on validated market requirements and technical foundations.

## Current Status: Devnet 1 Alpha

The initial version of devnet1 is currently running locally, implementing basic blockchain functionality and validator operations. This early implementation provides the foundation for our next development phases while validating core architectural decisions.

### Current Implementation

The system demonstrates basic functionality including:

1. Block Production
   - Genesis block creation
   - Block sequencing with timestamps
   - Basic transaction processing
   - Multi-validator coordination

2. Validator Operations
   - Basic node setup and operation
   - Hardware signature verification
   - Simple performance metrics
   - Network communication

3. Network Operations
   - Peer discovery and connection
   - Block distribution
   - Basic consensus operations
   - Network health monitoring

### Next Steps

The immediate focus for devnet1 includes:

1. GitHub Release Pipeline
   - Repository structure optimization
   - Release process documentation
   - Development workflow establishment
   - Community contribution guidelines

2. Validator Requirements
   - Hardware signature implementation
   - Basic latency measurements
   - Performance metric tracking
   - Network path validation

## Current Priority: FIX Protocol Integration

Our primary development focus is designing and implementing native FIX protocol support. This critical phase will determine how Rømer Chain integrates with existing financial infrastructure.

### Research Focus Areas

The FIX integration research encompasses several key areas:

1. Message Structure Analysis
   - Standard FIX message formats
   - Common order types
   - Execution reporting
   - Market data distribution
   - Administrative message handling

2. Block Structure Design
   - FIX message encapsulation
   - Transaction formatting
   - Order sequencing
   - State management
   - Execution tracking

3. Integration Architecture
   - Connection management
   - Session handling
   - Message routing
   - Performance optimization
   - Error handling

4. Market Maker Requirements
   - Order management workflows
   - Risk control integration
   - Position tracking needs
   - Market data requirements
   - System monitoring

### Development Goals

The FIX integration phase will focus on:

1. Block Design
   - Native FIX message support
   - Efficient transaction processing
   - Order management optimization
   - Market data handling
   - State transition management

2. Transaction Structure
   - FIX message validation
   - Order processing rules
   - Execution reporting
   - State updates
   - Event sequencing

3. Integration Testing
   - Message handling validation
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Error scenario testing
   - Recovery procedures
   - System monitoring

## Future Development: Economic Engine

Following successful FIX protocol integration, development will focus on implementing Rømer Chain's economic engine. This phase will only begin after thorough validation of the FIX integration and continued feedback from market makers.

The economic implementation will include:

1. Base Components
   - Validator rewards
   - Supply management
   - Transaction pricing
   - Network incentives

2. Market Operations
   - Regional market support
   - Geographic validation
   - Performance-based rewards
   - Market maker incentives

## Development Philosophy

Our development approach emphasizes:

1. Market Validation
   - Regular market maker feedback
   - Feature priority validation
   - Integration requirement verification
   - Performance metric confirmation

2. Incremental Progress
   - Focus on core functionality
   - Regular testing and validation
   - Continuous feedback integration
   - Measured feature addition

3. Integration First
   - FIX protocol prioritization
   - Market maker system compatibility
   - Existing infrastructure support
   - Industry standard alignment

## Immediate Next Steps

Current development priorities:

1. Complete Devnet1 GitHub Release
   - Repository preparation
   - Documentation updates
   - Release process establishment
   - Community guidelines

2. Begin FIX Protocol Research
   - Market maker interviews
   - Technical specification review
   - Integration architecture design
   - Implementation planning

3. Continue Market Maker Engagement
   - Technical feedback sessions
   - Integration requirement gathering
   - Feature priority validation
   - Partnership development

This roadmap will continue to evolve based on market maker feedback and technical validation results. Our focus remains on building infrastructure that serves real market making needs rather than theoretical possibilities.
