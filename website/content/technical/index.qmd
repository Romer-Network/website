# RØMER Chain: Purpose-Built Infrastructure for Market Makers

RØMER Chain reimagines blockchain infrastructure by putting market makers at the center of the system architecture. Through our combination of Commonware primitives, specialized Move VM, and geographic validation, we create a platform that delivers unprecedented advantages for professional market making operations.

## Performance Through Advanced Architecture

Our integration of Commonware primitives with decoupled state machine replication enables RØMER Chain to significantly outperform current trading-focused chains like dYdX, Sei, and Injective. By separating transaction ordering from execution, we achieve transaction acceptance in just two network hops and finality in three hops - far faster than traditional consensus mechanisms that require 4-6 hops for acceptance.

The Commonware foundation provides zero-copy message passing between components, optimized network topology for minimal latency, and hardware-level optimizations that create real performance advantages. When combined with our geographic validation system, this architecture enables true performance gains while maintaining security through physical decentralization.

## Specialized Market Making VM

Rather than using a general-purpose blockchain VM, RØMER implements a specialized version of the Move VM optimized specifically for market making operations. The VM includes native support for complex order types, position management, and risk limit enforcement directly at the instruction level.

A key innovation in our VM is native FIX protocol support, allowing market makers to submit FIX messages directly as transaction data types. These messages are interpreted and executed on-chain, creating seamless integration with existing trading infrastructure while maintaining the performance benefits of our specialized VM.

## Infrastructure Integration

RØMER nodes replace multiple pieces of traditional trading infrastructure while providing seamless integration with existing systems. Our native FIX protocol support means market makers can connect their current trading systems directly to RØMER nodes without building complex integration layers.

Each validator node becomes a complete trading infrastructure component, providing:

- Order management and execution
- Market data processing
- Position tracking
- Risk monitoring
- Cross-venue operations
- Regional market making capabilities

## Regional Advantages

Our geographic validation system creates natural advantages for market makers in their local regions. Validators gain priority access to local order flow, reduced latency for regional operations, and better relationships with local participants. This geographic distribution also provides natural MEV protection and enables true regional price discovery.

## Economic Benefits

The system creates multiple revenue streams while reducing operational costs. Market makers benefit from:

- Traditional market making spreads
- Validation rewards
- Protected regional advantages
- Reduced infrastructure costs
- Higher capital efficiency

## Next Steps
