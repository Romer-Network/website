# Romer Chain Development User Stories

## Overview

These user stories outline the initial development path for Romer Chain's Devnet1. We begin with fundamental network storage setup, then progress through client development for both market makers and stablecoin issuers. The stories are designed to be implemented sequentially, with each building on the capabilities established by previous stories.

## Story 1: Network Storage Initialization

As a Romer Chain developer  
I want to establish core network storage structures  
So that we can track organizations and tokens in our network  

### Background

Before we can handle account registration, our network needs fundamental data structures for tracking organizations and tokens. We implement these using Commonware's storage capabilities, ensuring consistent and efficient data management across the network.

### Technical Implementation

The story requires implementing two core structures in our Commonware storage layer:

Organization Storage:
```rust
pub struct Organization {
    // Unique identifier for the organization
    pub id: String,
    // Organization name
    pub name: String,
    // Organization type (Market Maker, Stablecoin Issuer)
    pub org_type: OrganizationType,
    // The organization's FIX sender comp ID
    pub sender_comp_id: String,
    // BLS public key for the organization
    pub public_key: BlsPublicKey,
    // Timestamp of registration
    pub registered_at: u64,
}
```

Token Storage:
```rust
pub struct Token {
    // Token identifier
    pub id: String,
    // Token name
    pub name: String,
    // Token symbol
    pub symbol: String,
    // Number of decimal places
    pub decimals: u8,
    // Issuing organization's ID
    pub issuer_id: String,
    // Total supply
    pub total_supply: u64,
    // Creation timestamp
    pub created_at: u64,
}
```

### Success Criteria

- Commonware storage implementation for organizations complete
- Commonware storage implementation for tokens complete
- Uniqueness constraints enforced for organization IDs and sender comp IDs
- Basic CRUD operations tested and verified
- Storage queries perform within expected latency bounds

## Story 2: Market Maker Registration Client

As a market maker  
I want to register my organization through a terminal interface  
So that I can prepare for trading operations  

### Background

Market makers need a straightforward way to register their organizations and establish their network identity. We'll create this using ratatui for a clean terminal user interface that guides them through the registration process.

### Technical Implementation

The story involves creating a ratatui-based client interface in our client crate:

Registration Interface Requirements:
- Organization name input
- Organization type selection
- SenderCompID input (with uniqueness verification)
- BLS key pair generation
- Registration confirmation display

Layout Components:
```rust
pub struct RegistrationForm {
    // Form fields
    pub name_input: Input,
    pub sender_comp_id_input: Input,
    pub org_type_select: Select,
    // Form state
    pub current_field: usize,
    pub error_message: Option<String>,
    pub success_message: Option<String>,
}
```

### Success Criteria

- Clean, intuitive terminal interface implemented
- Real-time SenderCompID uniqueness verification
- Secure BLS key generation and storage
- Clear error handling and user feedback
- Successful organization registration in network storage

## Story 3: Stablecoin Issuer Registration Client

As a stablecoin issuer  
I want to register my organization and define my token  
So that I can prepare to issue stablecoins on the network  

### Background

Stablecoin issuers require similar registration capabilities to market makers, but with additional functionality for defining their tokens. The registration process must ensure both organization and token details are properly recorded.

### Technical Implementation

Extends the registration interface to include token definition:

Token Definition Interface:
```rust
pub struct TokenDefinitionForm {
    // Token details
    pub name_input: Input,
    pub symbol_input: Input,
    pub decimals_input: Input,
    // Form state
    pub current_field: usize,
    pub validation_errors: Vec<String>,
}
```

Registration Flow:
1. Organization registration (similar to market maker)
2. Token definition
3. Registration confirmation

### Success Criteria

- Organization registration functions identical to market maker
- Token definition interface implemented
- Token parameters validated
- Token successfully registered in network storage
- Clear feedback throughout process

## Implementation Notes

### Common Components Needed

1. Key Management:
   - BLS key generation using Commonware cryptography
   - Secure key storage
   - Key backup functionality

2. Network Storage:
   - Organization registry
   - Token registry
   - Uniqueness enforcement
   - Query optimization

3. User Interface:
   - Form management
   - Input validation
   - Error handling
   - Status updates

### Testing Requirements

1. Storage Tests:
   - Uniqueness constraints
   - CRUD operations
   - Query performance
   - Error conditions

2. Interface Tests:
   - Input validation
   - Error handling
   - Success flows
   - Edge cases

3. Integration Tests:
   - End-to-end registration
   - Key generation
   - Storage persistence
   - Duplicate detection

### Security Considerations

1. Key Generation:
   - Secure randomness
   - Key protection
   - Backup procedures

2. Data Validation:
   - Input sanitization
   - Uniqueness verification
   - Format validation

3. Storage Security:
   - Access controls
   - Data integrity
   - Audit logging

These stories establish the foundation for Romer Chain's account management and token issuance capabilities. They focus on creating a robust, secure, and user-friendly registration process for both market makers and stablecoin issuers.
