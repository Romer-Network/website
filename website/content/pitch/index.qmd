## Vision: Purpose-Built Infrastructure for Market Makers

Rømer Chain reimagines blockchain infrastructure by putting market makers at the center of system design. Through specialized architecture and geographic validation, we create natural regional advantages that protect local market makers while ensuring true physical decentralization.

::: {.incremental}
- First blockchain optimized specifically for market making operations
- Native [FIX protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Information_eXchange) support for seamless infrastructure integration
- Protected regional markets through physical network topology
- Superior performance through advanced consensus mechanisms
:::

## The Market Opportunity

The global financial markets present a massive opportunity for blockchain integration:

::: {.incremental}
- $1.1 trillion in daily global equity trading volume
- FIX protocol handles $900 billion to $1 trillion of this volume
