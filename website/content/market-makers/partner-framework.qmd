# Rømer Chain Market Maker Partnership Framework

## Executive Summary

The Rømer Chain Market Maker Partnership Framework establishes a structured approach for engaging professional market makers in two critical phases: product validation and testnet deployment. This focused framework ensures that market makers can meaningfully contribute to and benefit from Rømer Chain's development, with clear pathways for increasing involvement as the project matures.

## Partnership Philosophy

Rømer Chain approaches market maker partnerships with two core principles:

First, we recognize that successful infrastructure must be built based on real market maker needs rather than theoretical requirements. This drives our emphasis on gathering detailed operational insights before writing significant code.

Second, we believe that early partners who help validate and test the system should receive meaningful economic participation rights that align long-term interests.

## Partnership Tiers

### Product Market Fit Partner

This tier focuses on market makers who can provide crucial insights during our product validation phase. It requires minimal technical commitment while offering significant potential benefits.

**Requirements:**

- Participation in 2-3 product requirements interviews (60 minutes each)
- Sharing of operational workflows and pain points
- Feedback on proposed technical solutions
- Input on feature prioritization

**Benefits:**

- Right of first refusal on SAFE investment rounds
- Early access to technical specifications
- Input on feature development priorities
- Option to upgrade to Testnet Partner status
- Regular development updates
- Recognition as founding research participant

### Testnet Partner

This tier is for market makers ready to deploy and test actual infrastructure. It builds on the Product Market Fit partnership with additional technical involvement and benefits.

**Requirements:**

- Maintaining validator infrastructure during testnet
- Meeting performance and uptime requirements
- Participating in network testing scenarios
- Providing detailed technical feedback
- Contributing to protocol improvements

**Benefits:**

- All Product Market Fit Partner benefits
- Testnet ROMER token emissions (maintained through mainnet migration)
- Priority access to geographic validation slots
- Direct technical support during deployment
- Participation in protocol refinement
- Enhanced influence on technical implementation
- Co-marketing opportunities
