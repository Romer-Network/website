# Market Maker Engagement Program: Shape the Future of Trading Infrastructure

## A Different Approach to Blockchain Development

Most blockchain projects start with technology and try to find users later. We're taking the opposite approach: starting with market makers' needs and building technology to serve them. Before writing significant code, we want to deeply understand how market makers actually operate and what they truly need from their infrastructure.

## Why Engage With Us Now?

We understand that as an early-stage project, we're asking for your valuable time. In return, we're offering something unique: the opportunity to shape critical infrastructure from the ground up, backed by meaningful economic participation in the project's future.

### What We're Offering

1. Priority Access Agreement

   - Early access to all testing phases
   - Direct influence over feature prioritization
   - Premium support during launch phases

2. Economic Participation Rights
   - Right of first refusal on SAFE investment rounds
   - Preferential terms for early backers
   - Validator reward multipliers during initial network phases
   - Reserved allocation in token distribution events

3. Strategic Partnership Benefits
   - Direct access to our technical team
   - Custom feature development consideration
   - Priority integration support
   - Co-marketing opportunities

## Streamlined Engagement Process

We value your time and have designed our engagement process to be efficient and flexible:

### Initial Meeting (30 minutes)
A focused introduction where you can:

- Learn about Rømer Chain's vision
- Ask questions about our approach
- Evaluate potential alignment
- Decide if further engagement makes sense

If you see value in continuing the conversation, we move to:

### Product Requirements Sessions (2 x 60 minutes)
Two focused sessions to understand:

- Your operational workflows
- Technical requirements
- Integration needs
- Feature priorities

These sessions are scheduled at your convenience and can be spread over several weeks to accommodate your schedule.

## What We're Seeking to Understand

Through our conversations, we aim to learn about:

1. Real Operational Challenges
   - Current infrastructure pain points
   - Risk management requirements
   - Integration bottlenecks
   - Regulatory compliance needs

2. Technical Requirements
   - Trading system architecture
   - Order management workflows
   - Market data requirements
   - Integration preferences

3. Business Operations
   - Regional market dynamics
   - Liquidity management strategies
   - Cross-venue operations
   - Risk mitigation approaches

## Flexibility in Engagement

We understand that different organizations have different requirements for information sharing and confidentiality. Our engagement process can be tailored to your needs:

- Optional mutual NDA available if desired
- Flexible meeting scheduling
- Remote or in-person sessions
- Adjustable scope of technical discussion

## Why This Approach Matters

The blockchain industry has largely ignored the specific needs of market makers, instead forcing you to adapt to infrastructure designed for other purposes. By starting with your requirements and building specifically for market makers, we can create something fundamentally different: infrastructure that works the way you do.

## The Process

1. Initial Discussion (30 minutes)
   - Introduction to Rømer Chain
   - Q&A session
   - Evaluation of potential collaboration
   - Decision on further engagement

2. Technical Deep Dive (If proceeding)
   - Two 60-minute product requirements sessions
   - Review of your technical needs
   - Feature prioritization discussion
   - Integration requirements analysis

3. Ongoing Relationship
   - Regular updates on development
   - Early access to prototypes
   - Continued input opportunities
   - Strategic partnership development

## Next Steps
