# Reimagining Blockchain Infrastructure for Market Makers

Rømer Chain introduces a revolutionary approach to blockchain architecture by placing market makers at the core of network operations. Through our innovative Proof of Physics consensus mechanism, we create a system that naturally protects regional market makers while ensuring true physical decentralization across the globe.
