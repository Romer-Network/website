# Rømer Chain: The First Layer 1 Built for Market Makers

Rømer Chain reimagines blockchain infrastructure by putting market makers at the center of network operations. Through our unique Proof of Physics consensus mechanism, we create natural regional advantages that protect local market makers while ensuring true physical decentralization.

## For Market Makers

As a market maker, your validator node becomes your complete trading infrastructure. Take control of your regional market:
