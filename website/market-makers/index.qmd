# Market Makers: Help Build Your Future Infrastructure

As market makers, your edge comes from deep understanding of local markets and the ability to react quickly to opportunities. But this advantage is constantly under threat from global firms using cloud infrastructure to compete in your region. Rømer Chain is building the first blockchain infrastructure that protects and enhances your regional advantage.

## Development Roadmap

### Devnet 1: Protecting Regional Advantages
Our first development phase focuses on the foundation of regional market making: ensuring validators are physically present in their operating regions. This creates natural geographic advantages that cloud providers cannot replicate, protecting local market makers from global firms attempting to compete in multiple regions simultaneously.

Think of this as building the secure foundation that protects your regional trading advantage. When you operate a Rømer validator, you gain natural latency advantages that distant competitors cannot overcome, regardless of their technical resources.

Current Status: We are implementing and testing our core validator infrastructure with built-in geographic protections.

### Devnet 2: Building Your Trading Infrastructure
The second phase focuses on integrating professional trading capabilities directly into validator nodes. We're starting with the most critical component: comprehensive multi-signature functionality that mirrors how trading firms actually operate.

Key Features Under Development:
- Role-based access control for trading operations
- Configurable approval thresholds based on trade size
- Time-locked transaction scheduling
- Emergency shutdown capabilities
- Audit trail and compliance reporting

We Need Your Input: This is where you come in. We want to build infrastructure that serves your actual needs. We're seeking conversations with market makers to understand:

1. Your current operational workflows
2. Risk management requirements
3. Integration needs with existing systems
4. Regulatory compliance considerations
5. Feature prioritization for future development

## Early Engagement Program
