    "text": "Rømer Chain is a trailblazing blockchain network that leverages the immutable laws of physics to establish security and achieve consensus. By rooting its foundation in real-world geographic decentralization and network topology, Rømer introduces a fundamentally new paradigm for constructing trustless, permissionless systems.\nThe beating heart of Rømer is its pioneering Proof of Physics consensus mechanism. Breaking away from traditional proof-of-work or proof-of-stake models, validator selection in Rømer is determined solely by empirically demonstrated network performance. The protocol seamlessly integrates with over 100 critical internet exchange points and undersea cable landing locations worldwide. It meticulously measures validators’ network latencies, regional connectivity, infrastructure robustness, and reliability. These metrics, anchored in the physical constants of the universe and the speed of light, are exceptionally resistant to manipulation by attackers.\nTo ensure validators are truly geographically distributed, they must periodically submit zero-knowledge proofs attesting to their physical presence in the claimed location. This innovative use of cryptography allows validators to prove they are operating from a specific region without revealing their exact location, preserving privacy while assuring physical decentralization. Importantly, cloud providers are strictly prohibited from participating as validators. Each validator must run their own hardware in a real-world location, preventing centralization in large data centers.\nThis uncompromising approach propels the network towards maximal geographic decentralization. To join as a validator, nodes must operate high-performance network infrastructure with low-latency, redundant connections to multiple global regions. Executing an attack would necessitate seizing substantial physical hardware across numerous continents. Significantly, Rømer imposes no minimum staking requirement to become a validator, enabling genuinely permissionless participation based purely on capability.\nOn the economic front, Rømer employs an Austrian-inspired model. The protocol targets a fixed, nominal cost for computation. If demand surpasses this baseline, Rømer automatically adjusts the token supply to maintain stable costs. This empowers the network to fluidly adapt to real usage, with supply dynamically expanding to accommodate organic growth. Notably, all new tokens minted to sustain computational stability are funneled into a community treasury. Every quarter, the community allocates these treasury funds through a democratic quadratic voting system, ensuring decentralized governance and nurturing ecosystem development.\nWhile Rømer structurally minimizes miner extractable value (MEV) by eschewing transaction fees, it proactively tackles any residual MEV concerns by integrating with Flashbots Buildernet. This allows searchers to extract MEV through transparent, efficient means without impacting users or introducing blockchain instability. By confronting MEV head-on, Rømer ensures a fair and equitable environment for all participants.\nRømer is fully EVM compatible, empowering developers to effortlessly port their existing Solidity smart contracts. The network boasts high throughput and rapid settlement, with the majority of transactions reaching irreversible finality under a second.\nBy synergizing physical security guarantees, genuine geographic decentralization, and market-responsive economic policies, Rømer Chain blazes a new trail for next-generation blockchain infrastructure. It delivers the performance and dependability imperative for global-scale applications, while remaining staunchly permissionless and resistant to censorship or control. Rømer offers a robust foundational layer for the burgeoning decentralized economy, all without relying on staking, minimum deposits, or conventional economic security models. With its groundbreaking Proof of Physics consensus, zero-knowledge validated geographic distribution, and community-governed treasury, Rømer Chain is poised to revolutionize the blockchain landscape."
